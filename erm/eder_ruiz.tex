\section{Summary}    

I'm passionate about understanding how things work and what fascinates me most is the world of computing. This fascination quickly led me to the world of Linux and Open Source which in those days meant knowing how to use the command line to operate the system.

At university Pascal was the first language I learnt, but C quickly became my favourite programming language. Since then I have had experience with several other languages and paradigms, including Delphi, Pascal, C, Assembly x86, C++, Java, Shell Script, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Prolog, Awk, Lua, Wiring, Matlab, Verilog and HDL. I know some of them deeply, others just superficially. Among the languages that I don't know, some I hope not to need, others I can't wait for the contact, such as R and Go.

My professional experience is very strong in Linux, Embedded Linux, C and microcontrollers. Also I've worked with web applications and mobile (Android). I recently had contact with FPGA, GPU, image processing and computer vision. Topics that also interest me are Operating Systems, Real Time Systems, Distributed Systems, High Availability, Fault Tolerance, Data Science and Cloud Computing.

Feel free to get in touch and to look my detailed professional experiences below. You can find my open source projects at my github account in https://github.com/ederrm.
