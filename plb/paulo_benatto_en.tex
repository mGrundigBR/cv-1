\section{Summary} My name is Paulo Leonardo Benatto, aka Patito, a Brazillian software developer that resembles a hobbit \_o/. I graduated in Computer Science in 2008, however, I have been working with Linux since 2002. I started with Debian Potato (mount /dev/fd0 =), good times!   

After university I moved to Florianopolis, a city in south Brazil, where I started working as a Jr. Software Developer. Since then I have worked in several companies using different technologies, such as: C/C++, Python, JavaScript, Linux and so on.

In 2014, I decided to leave Brazil and try a new experience in England, make new friends and drink some pints. I started working as busser at Planet Hollywood. It was a fun job, but hard in the same time. After 2 months working in Planet Hollywood, Brandwatch invited me to hold a position as Linux System Administrator and I had a chance to learn a lot about the sysadmin/devops world.

At the end of last year I began learning the Go programming language, I bought some books, attended a Go conference and started following the Go community. This year I was given the opportunity to work at Sainsburys Digital Labs where I’m developing microservices in GoLang.

I believe I am a good mood person that enjoys working in agile teams and open-minded companies. I also consider myself hardworking with can-do attitude and I really like to learn and share knowledge.
